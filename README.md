# CRUD Operations - Spring Boot

This repository demonstrates the implementation of basic CRUD operations using Spring Boot 🌱. It serves as a foundation for building REST APIs that allow the user to perform standard database operations on entities such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. The repository utilizes Spring Data JPA for database interaction, making the operations seamless and easy to manage.

## Key Features:

#### Update ✏️: Modifies the details of existing records in the database.
#### Delete 🗑️: Removes records from the database.

The repository is set up with Spring Boot 🌱 and can be easily integrated into any Java application for rapid development. It also serves as a template for building more complex features by expanding the CRUD functionality.
